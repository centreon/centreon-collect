## Installing from binaries

> Centreon Clib is a low-level component of the Centreon
> software suite. If this is your first installation you would probably
> want to [install it entirely](https://docs.centreon.com/current/en/installation/installation-of-a-central-server/using-sources.html).

Centreon ([the company behind the Centreon software suite](http://www.centreon.com))
provides binary packages for RedHat / CentOS. They are available either
as part of the [Centreon Platform](https://www.centreon.com/en/platform/)
or as individual packages on [our RPM repository](https://docs.centreon.com/current/en/installation/installation-of-a-poller/using-packages.html).

Once the repository installed a simple command will be needed to install
Centreon Clib.

```shell
yum install centreon-clib
```

## Fetching sources

Beware that the repository hosts in-development sources and that it
might not work at all.

Stable releases are available as gziped tarballs on [Centreon's
download site](https://download.centreon.com).

## Compilation

This paragraph is only a quickstart guide for the compilation of
Centreon Clib.

### CentOS / Debian / Raspbian

Compilation of these distributions is pretty straightforward.

You'll need to download the project and launch the *cmake.sh* script
to prepare the compilation environment:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/centreon/centreon-clib
cd centreon-clib
./cmake.sh
```

Now launch the compilation using the *make* command and then install the
software by running *make install* as priviledged user:

```shell
cd build
make
make install
```

### Other distributions

If you are on another distribution, then follow the steps below.

Check if you have these packages installed (Note that packages names
come from CentOS distributions, so if some packages names don't match
on your distribution try to find their equivalent names): git, make,
cmake.

You can now prepare the compilation environment:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/centreon/centreon-clib
mkdir -p centreon-clib/build
cd centreon-clib/build
cmake -DWITH_PREFIX=/usr -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DWITH_PREFIX_LIB=/usr/lib64 -DWITH_TESTING=On  ..
```

Now launch the compilation using the *make* command and then install the
software by running *make install* as priviledged user:

```shell
make
make install
```

You're done!
