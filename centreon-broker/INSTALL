     CentreonBroker

------------------------


CentreonBroker can easily be built using GNU's autoconf and automake. In the
./build/GNU directory of the repository you will find the configure.ac and
Makefile.am files which can be used to generate necessary scripts using the
command :

  $> autoreconf --install

Then, configure you're software build using the configure script.
CentreonBroker has some external dependencies which can be either mandatory or
optional. If these dependencies are not in default paths, call configure with
the appropriate flags (see ./configure --help). CentreonBroker's dependencies
are :

  Required:
    - Boost
    - Boost::Thread
  Optional:
    - libmysql (for MySQL support)
    - libpq (for PostgreSQL support)
    - ocilib (for Oracle support)
    - GNU TLS (for TLS support)

By default the command :

  $> ./configure

will configure CentreonBroker to support only MySQL.

Once the software is configure'd, simply run make.

  $> make

Every source file will be build and finally linked together to generate the
cb2db binary.
