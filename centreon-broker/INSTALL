CentreonBroker can easily be built using GNU's autoconf and automake. In the
./build/GNU directory of the repository you will find the configure.ac and
Makefile.am files which can be used to generate necessary scripts using the
command :

  $> autoreconf --install

Then, configure you're software build using the configure script.
CentreonBroker has some external dependencies which can be either mandatory or
optional. If these dependencies are not in default paths, call configure with
the appropriate flags (see ./configure --help). CentreonBroker's dependencies
are :

  Required:
    - pthread
    - SOCI
  Optional:
    - SOCI::MySQL
    - GNU TLS

By default the command :

  $> ./configure

will configure CentreonBroker with MySQL and TLS.

Once the software is configure'd, simply run make.

  $> make

On successful completion, the binary files cb2db and cbmod.so are created and
usable as a standalone daemon (cb2db) or a Nagios plugin (cbmod.so).
