UPGRADE NOTES
-------------

You will most likely need to upgrade the database schema when upgrading to
new releases of the NDOUtils addon.  You can do these easily by using the
'upgradedb' script in the db/ subdirectory as follows:

	cd db
	./upgradedb

You'll need to specify the database name, host, password, and username when 
using the upgrade script.


Upgrading from the 1.3 or 1.3.1 releases:

	* The default table prefixed has changed from 'ndo_' to 'nagios_'
	* Several changes have been made to the DB structure
	* Use the mysql-upgrade-1.3.sql script in the db/ directory to upgrade your
	  old DB to the new structure (back it up first!).
