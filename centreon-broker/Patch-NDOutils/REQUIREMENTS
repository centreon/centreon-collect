NDO REQUIREMENTS
----------------

Because the NDOMOD event broker module traverses internal object structures in
the Nagios daemon, it is highly sensitive to code and structure changes that
occur throughout the Nagios development process.  Therefore, it is very important
that you are using a version of the NDO utilities that matches your current
Nagios installation.

This version of the NDO utilities requires that you:

1. are either running Nagios Nagios 2.x or 3.x (see below for details)

2. compiled the Nagios daemon with event broker support (enabled by default).


Version Compatability Details
-----------------------------

If you're using the NDOUtils addon, you'll have to watch out for changing
version requirements as your upgrade your Nagios installation.  This is
particularly true if you are running the Nagios 3.x alpha/beta code, as
internal data structures are changing throughout the development process.

Make sure the check the Changelog for specific Nagios version requirements
for each release of NDOUtils.
