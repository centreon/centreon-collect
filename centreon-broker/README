If you're searching how to build the software, please refer to the INSTALL
file.

CentreonBroker aims to be an alternative to NDOUtils or any other solution
whose role is to transfer Nagios data from Nagios itself to a database. For
now, CentreonBroker only have a daemon which stores data within a MySQL
database. Its input comes from the traditional NDOUtils' ndomod.

CentreonBroker is designed to provide in the near future support for more
databases (PostgreSQL and Oracle being the first). CentreonBroker use modern
software technologies (like threads and prepared statements) to provide the
best software performances right out of the box.
