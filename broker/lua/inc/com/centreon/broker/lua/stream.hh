/**
 *  @class stream stream.hh "com/centreon/broker/lua/stream.hh"
 *  @brief lua stream.
 *
 *  Stream events into lua database.
 *  This stream runs its own thread. The write() internal function pushes to
 *  its exposed queue some events.
 *
 *  The stream thread has its own queue. When it is empty, this queue is swapped
 *  with the exposed queue. This allows to pop events from it without locking
 *  any mutex.
 *
 *  In case of the mutex's queue full, the write function is more called. The
 *  muxer waits for events to be acknowledged before sending again new events.
 *  This procedure is done through the flush() function. In this stream, the
 *  flush function sets a flag _flush to true. Then the stream thread gets the
 *  information of a flush call and can call it.
 *
 *  When the flush flag is false, and the queue is empty, if it is not time to
 *  exit, the thread waits for 500ms before rechecking events.
