 *  @class monitoring_stream monitoring_stream.hh
 * "com/centreon/broker/bam/monitoring_stream.hh"
 *  @brief bam monitoring_stream.
 *
 *  Handle perfdata and insert proper informations in index_data and
 *  metrics table of a centbam DB.
 *
 *  This class also sends external commands to centengine, two kinds of
 *  commands:
 *  * **forced service checks** because each BA is represented by a service on
 *  centengine side and when a BA changes of state, the service has also to be
 *  updated.
 *  * **downtimes** because if an inherited downtime is set on a BA, we have to
 *  apply a "downtime" on its corresponding service.
 *
 *  Forced checks can be numerous and we see sometimes many forced checks on the
 *  same service, this is because of the tree structure of BAs. To avoid asking
 *  centengine too many forced checks, broker stores them in the
 *  _forced_svc_checks set, keeping them during 5s and each time a new check is
 *  added to that set, the scheduling is reset to a new duration of 5s. Then
 *  thanks to the structure of a set we are sure each service will receive a
 *  forced check only once. As the timer that sends messages is in another
 *  thread, we have to protect _forced_svc_checks with a mutex
 *  _forced_svc_checks_m.
 *  There is also another set named _timer_forced_svc_checks. This one is the
 *  property of the timer. When it is launched, _forced_svc_checks data are
 *  transfered to _timer_forced_svc_checks. We keep this set as attribute in
 *  case of the timer fails to send messages. The function is not blocking and
 *  will just make a new attempt in 5s.
