/**
 * @class bulk_queries "com/centreon/broker/unified_sql/bulk_queries.hh"
 * @brief Container for big queries.
 *
 * If for example, we have many custom
 * variables to insert into the customvariables table, it is the good class to
 * use. The idea is very simple, the bulk is constructed with an interval in
 * seconds, a max queries count and a template of the query to execute.
 * Regularly, we call the method ready(), if it returns true then the limit
 * time or the max number of rows are reached. And we can get the query to
 * execute with the get_query() method. Once this last method called, the stack
 * is empty and ready() will return true once one of the two conditions are
 * reached again.
 *
 * Queries are not done directly by this class because it has no idea of the
 * connection to use nor the client configuration, it is only a container.
 *
 * How it works:
 * @code
 * bulk_queries bq(10, 15, "INSERT INTO test (col_a, col_b) VALUES {}");
 * bq.push_query("\"foo\", \"bar\"");
 * bq.push_query("\"foo1\", \"bar1\"");
 * ...
 * if (bq.ready()) {
 *   std::string q = bq.get_query();
 *   mysql->run_query(q);
 * }
 * @endcode
 * The query content is
 * `INSERT INTO test (col_a, col_b) VALUES ("foo", "bar"), ("foo1", "bar1")`
