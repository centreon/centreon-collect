/**
 * @brief A severity is a way to give some importance to a resource. It has a
 * level that is an integer from 1. 1 is more important than 2, than 3...
 * It also has an id, a level, an icon_id and a name.
 *
 * Because a severity can be sent from several poller, and by moment a poller
 * can say it does not need it anymore, broker needs to know from which poller
 * the severity event comes from, so we have a poller_id in the message.
 *
 * For example, two pollers use a severity named 'foo'. Then the first one sends
 * a Severity message with the action DELETE. This means this poller does not
 * need it anymore but we don't know about the other poller. Then we can remove
 * relations between resources of our poller and this severity. And only if the
 * severity is no more used at all, we can remove it.
