# file:  resource.cfg
# brief: Sample Resource File for Centreon Engine @VERSION@
#
# You can define $USERx$ macros in this file, which can in turn be used in
# command definitions in your host config file(s).  $USERx$ macros are useful
# for storing sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, etc. They are
# also handy for specifying the path to plugins and event handlers - if you
# decide to move the plugins or event handlers to a different directory in the
# future, you can just update one or two $USERx$ macros, instead of modifying a
# lot of command definitions.
#
# Centreon Engine supports up to 32 $USERx$ macros ($USER1$ through $USER32$)
#
# Resource files may also be used to store configuration directives for external
# data sources like MySQL...

# Sets $USER1$ to be the path to the plugins.
$USER1$=@PREFIX_BIN@

# Sets $USER2$ to be the path to event handlers.
#$USER2$=@PREFIX_BIN@/eventhandlers

# Store some usernames and passwords.
#$USER3$=someuser
#$USER4$=somepassword
