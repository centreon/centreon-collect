BA_IMPACT_IMPACT
    [Documentation]    A BA of type impact is defined with two BAs of type impact
    ...    as children. The first child has an impact of 90 and the
    ...    second one of 10. When they are impacting both, the
    ...    parent should be critical. When they are not impacting,
    ...    the parent should be ok.
