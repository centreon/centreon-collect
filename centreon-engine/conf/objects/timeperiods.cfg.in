# file:  timeperiods.cfg
# brief: Sample timeperiod definitions.
#
# notes: This config file provides you with some example timeperiod definitions
#        that you can reference in host, service, contact, and dependency
#        definitions.
#
#        You don't need to keep timeperiods in a separate file from your other
#        object definitions.  This has been done just to make things easier to
#        understand.


# info:  Time periods.
# brief: This defines a timeperiod where all times are valid for checks,
#        notifications, etc.  The classic "24x7" support nightmare. :-)
