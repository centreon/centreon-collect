# file:  contacts.cfg
# brief: Sample contact/contactgroup definitions.
#
# notes: This config file provides you with some example contact and contact
#        group definitions that you can reference in host and service
#        definitions.
#
#        You don't need to keep these definitions in a separate file from your
#        other object definitions.  This has been done just to make things
#        easier to understand.


# info:  Contacts.
# brief: Just one contact defined by default - the Centreon Engine admin (that's
#        you). This contact definition inherits a lot of default values from the
#        'generic-contact' template which is defined elsewhere.

define contact{
  contact_name  centengineadmin       ; Short name of user.
  use           generic-contact       ; Inherit default values from
                                      ; generic-contact template (defined above).
  alias         Centreon Engine Admin ; Full name of user.
  email         root@localhost        ; CHANGE THIS TO YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS.
}


# info:  Contact groups.
# brief: We only have one contact in this simple configuration file, so there is
#        no need to create more than one contact group.

define contactgroup{
  contactgroup_name  admins
  alias              Centreon Engine Administrators
  members            centengineadmin
}
