# This script is intended to run as the OCSP command
# on a distributed monitoring server.  The script calls
# submit_check_result_via_nsca to send the service check
# results to the central monitoring server.
#
# Arguments:
#  $1 = host_name (Short name of host that the service is
#       associated with)
#  $2 = svc_description (Description of the service)
#  $3 = state_string (A string representing the status of
#       the given service - "OK", "WARNING", "CRITICAL"
#       or "UNKNOWN")
#  $4 = plugin_output (A text string that should be used
#       as the plugin output for the service checks)
#

# Location of the submit_check_result_via_nsca script
SubmitCmd="/usr/local/nagios/libexec/eventhandlers/submit_check_result_via_nsca"

# Convert the state string to the corresponding return code
return_code=-1
