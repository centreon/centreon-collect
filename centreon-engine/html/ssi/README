NAGIOS CGI SSI FILE README
==========================

This folder may contain optional header and footer files that will 
be added to the CGI HTML output.  The files you put can contain server
side include (SSI) statements.

There are two types of header and footer files - common headers/footers
and CGI-specific headers/footers.  Common header/footer files (if present)
will be included in the output of ALL CGIs.  CGI-specific header/footer
files (if present) will be included in the output of the CGI they are 
intended for.  

The order in which headers/footers are included with regards to the CGI
output and each other is shown below:

1. COMMON HEADER
2. CGI-SPECIFIC HEADER
3. CGI OUTPUT
4. CGI-SPECIFIC FOOTER
5. COMMON FOOTER

The header/footer files you create must be named exactly as shown below
in order to be included in the CGI output:

Common headers/footers:

	common-header.ssi
	common-footer.ssi

CGI-specific header/footers:
