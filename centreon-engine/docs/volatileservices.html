<strong><u>Introduction</u></strong>

</p>



<p>

Nagios has the ability to distinguish between "normal" services and "volatile" services.  The <i>is_volatile</i> option in each service definition allows you to specify whether a specific service is volatile or not.  For most people, the majority of all monitored services will be non-volatile (i.e. "normal").  However, volatile services can be very useful when used properly...

</p>



<p>

<strong><u>What Are They Useful For?</u></strong>

</p>



<p>

Volatile services are useful for monitoring...

</p>



<ul>

<li>Things that automatically reset themselves to an "OK" state each time they are checked

<li>Events such as security alerts which require attention every time there is a problem (and not just the first time)

</ul>



<p>

<strong><u>What's So Special About Volatile Services?</u></strong>

</p>



<p>

Volatile services differ from "normal" services in three important ways.  <i>Each time</i> they are checked when they are in a <a href="statetypes.html">hard</a> non-OK state, and the check returns a non-OK state (i.e. no state change has occurred)...

</p>



<ul>

<li>The non-OK service state is logged

<li>Contacts are notified about the problem (if that's <a href="notifications.html">what should be done</a>).  Note: Notification intervals are ignored for volatile services.

<li>The <a href="eventhandlers.html">event handler</a> for the service is run (if one has been defined)

</ul>



<p>

These events normally only occur for services when they are in a non-OK state and a hard state change has just occurred.  In other words, they only happen the first time that a service goes into a non-OK state.  If future checks of the service result in the same non-OK state, no hard state change occurs and none of the events mentioned take place again.

</p>

</p>



<p>

<strong><u>The Power Of Two</u></strong>

</p>



<p>

If you combine the features of volatile services and <a href="passivechecks.html">passive service checks</a>, you can do some very useful things.  Examples of this include handling SNMP traps, security alerts, etc.

</p>



<p>

How about an example... Let's say you're running <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/sentrytools/">PortSentry</a> to detect port scans on your machine and automatically firewall potential intruders.  If you want to let Nagios know about port scans, you could do the following...

</p>



<p>

<b>Nagios Configuration:</b>

</p>



<ul>

<li>Create a service definition called <i>Port Scans</i> and associate it with the host that PortSentry is running on.

<li>Set the <i>max_check_attempts</i> directive in the service definition to 1.  This will tell Nagios to immediate force the service into a <a href="statetypes.html">hard state</a> when a non-OK state is reported.

<li>Set the <i>active_checks_enabled</i> directive in the service definition to 0. This prevents Nagios from actively checking the service.

<li>Set the <i>passive_checks_enabled</i> directive in the service definition to 1. This enables passive checks for the service.

<li>Set this <i>is_volatile</i> directive in the service definition to 1.</li>

</ul>



<p>

<b>PortSentry Configuration:</b>

</p>



<p>

Edit your PortSentry configuration file (portsentry.conf) and define a command for the <i>KILL_RUN_CMD</i> directive as follows:

</p>

<pre>

KILL_RUN_CMD="/usr/local/Nagios/libexec/eventhandlers/submit_check_result host_name 'Port Scans' 2 'Port scan from host $TARGET$ on port $PORT$.  Host has been firewalled.'"

</pre>

<p>

Make sure to replace <i>host_name</i> with the short name of the host that the service is associated with.

</p>



<p>

<b>Port Scan Script:</b>

</p>



<p>

Create a shell script in the <i>/usr/local/nagios/libexec/eventhandlers</i> directory named <i>submit_check_result</i>.  The contents of the shell script should be something similiar to the following...

</p>



<pre>

	#!/bin/sh

 

	# Write a command to the Nagios command file to cause

	# it to process a service check result

 

	echocmd="/bin/echo"

 

	CommandFile="/usr/local/nagios/var/rw/nagios.cmd"

 

	# get the current date/time in seconds since UNIX epoch

	datetime=`date +%s`

 

	# create the command line to add to the command file

	cmdline="[$datetime] PROCESS_SERVICE_CHECK_RESULT;$1;$2;$3;$4"

 

	# append the command to the end of the command file

	`$echocmd $cmdline >> $CommandFile`

</pre>



<p>

What will happen when PortSentry detects a port scan on the machine in the future?

</p>



<ul>

<li>PortSentry will firewall the host (this is a function of the PortSentry software)

<li>PortSentry will execute the <i>submit_check_result</i> shell script and send a passive check result to Nagios

<li>Nagios will read the external command file and see the passive service check submitted by PortSentry

<li>Nagios will put the <i>Port Scans</i> service in a hard CRITICAL state and send notifications to contacts 

</ul>



<p>

Pretty neat, huh?
