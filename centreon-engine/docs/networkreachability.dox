 *  @section determiningstatusandreachabilityofnetworkhostsintroduction Introduction
 *
 *  If you've ever work in tech support, you've undoubtably had users
 *  tell you "the Internet is down". As a techie, you're pretty sure
 *  that no one pulled the power cord from the Internet. Something must
 *  be going wrong somewhere between the user's chair and the Internet.
 *
 *  Assuming its a technical problem, you begin to search for the
 *  problem. Perhaps the user's computer is turned off, maybe their
 *  network cable is unplugged, or perhaps your organization's core
 *  router just took a dive. Whatever the problem might be, one thing
 *  is most certain - the Internet isn't down. It just happens to be
 *  unreachable for that user.
 *
 *  Centreon Scheduler is able to determine whether the hosts you're
 *  monitoring are in a DOWN or UNREACHABLE state. These are very
 *  different (although related) states and can help you quickly
 *  determine the root cause of network problems. Here's how the
 *  reachability logic works to distinguish between these two states...
 *
 *  @section determiningstatusandreachabilityofnetworkhostsexamplenetwork Example Network
 *
 *  Take a look at the simple network diagram below. For this example,
 *  lets assume you're monitoring all the hosts (server, routers,
 *  switches, etc) that are pictured. Centreon Scheduler is installed
 *  and running on the Centreon Scheduler host.

 *  @section determiningstatusandreachabilityofnetworkhostsdefiningparentchildrelationships Defining Parent/Child Relationships
 *
 *  In order for Centreon Scheduler to be able to distinguish between
 *  DOWN and UNREACHABLE states for the hosts that are being monitored,
 *  you'll need to tell Centreon Scheduler how those hosts are connected
 *  to each other - from the standpoint of the Centreon Scheduler
 *  daemon. To do this, trace the path that a data packet would take
 *  from the Centreon Scheduler daemon to each individual host. Each
 *  switch, router, and server the packet encounters or passes through
 *  is considered a "hop" and will require that you define a
 *  parent/child host relationship in Centreon Scheduler. Here's what
 *  the host parent/child relationships look like from the viewpoint of
 *  Centreon Scheduler:
 *
 *  @image html reachability2.png
 *  @image latex reachability2.eps
 *
 *  Now that you know what the parent/child relationships look like for
 *  hosts that are being monitored, how do you configure Centreon
 *  Scheduler to reflect them? The parents directive in your
 *  @ref objectdefinitionsobjecttypeshostdefinition "host definitions" allows you to
 *  do this. Here's what the (abbreviated) host definitions with
 *  parent/child relationships would look like for this example:
 *
 *  @code
 *  define host{
 *    host_name Centreon Scheduler ; <-- The local host has no parent - it is the topmost host
 *  }
 *
 *  define host{
 *    host_name Switch1
 *    parents   Centreon Scheduler
 *  }
 *
 *  define host{
 *    host_name Web
 *    parents   Switch1
 *  }
 *
 *  define host{
 *    host_name FTP
 *    parents   Switch1
 *  }
 *
 *  define host{
 *    host_name Router1
 *    parents   Switch1
 *  }
 *
 *  define host{
 *    host_name Switch2
 *    parents   Router1
 *  }
 *
 *  define host{
 *    host_name Wkstn1
 *    parents   Switch2
 *  }
 *
 *  define host{
 *    host_name HPLJ2605
 *    parents   Switch2
 *  }
 *
 *  define host{
 *    host_name Router2
 *    parents   Router1
 *  }
 *
 *  define host{
 *    host_name somewebsite.com
 *    parents   Router2
 *  }
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  @section determiningstatusandreachabilityofnetworkhostsreachabilitylogicinaction Reachability Logic in Action
 *
 *  Now that you're configured Centreon Scheduler with the proper
 *  parent/child relationships for your hosts, let's see what happen
 *  when problems arise. Assume that two hosts - Web and Router1 - go
 *  offline...
 *
 *  @image html reachability3.png
 *  @image latex reachability3.eps
 *
 *  When hosts change state (i.e. from UP to DOWN), the host
 *  reachability logic in Centreon Scheduler kicks in. The reachability
 *  logic will initiate parallel checks of the parents and children of
 *  whatever hosts change state. This allows Centreon Scheduler to
 *  quickly determine the current status of your network infrastructure
 *  when changes occur.
 *
 *  @image html reachability4.png
 *  @image latex reachability4.eps
 *
 *  In this example, Centreon Scheduler will determine that Web and
 *  Router1 are both in DOWN states because the "path" to those hosts
 *  is not being blocked.
 *
 *  Centreon Scheduler will determine that all the hosts "beneath"
 *  Router1 are all in an UNREACHABLE state because Centreon Scheduler
 *  can't reach them. Router1 is DOWN and is blocking the path to those
 *  other hosts. Those hosts might be running fine, or they might be
 *  offline - Centreon Scheduler doesn't know because it can't reach
 *  them. Hence Centreon Scheduler considers them to be UNREACHABLE
 *  instead of DOWN.
 *
 *  @section determiningstatusandreachabilityofnetworkhostsunreachablestatesandnotifications UNREACHABLE States and Notifications
 *
 *  By default, Centreon Scheduler will notify contacts about both DOWN
 *  and UNREACHABLE host states. As an admin/tech, you might not want
 *  to get notifications about hosts that are UNREACHABLE. You know
 *  your network structure, and if Centreon Scheduler notifies you that
 *  your router/firewall is down, you know that everything behind it is
 *  unreachable.
 *
 *  If you want to spare yourself from a flood of UNREACHABLE
 *  notifications during network outages, you can exclude the
 *  unreachable (u) option from the notification_options directive in
 *  your @ref objectdefinitionsobjecttypeshostdefinition "host" definitions
 *  and/or the host_notification_options directive in your
 *  @ref objectdefinitionsobjecttypescontactdefinition "contact" definitions.
