 *
 *  - Exclusions and Host/Service Checks - There is a bug in the
 *  service/host check scheduling logic that rears its head when you
 *  use timeperiod definitions that use the exclude directive. The
 *  problem occurs when Centreon Scheduler Core tries to re-schedule the
 *  next check. In this case, the scheduling logic may incorrectly
 *  schedule the next check further out in the future than it should.
 *  In essence, it skips over the (missing) logic where it could
 *  determine an earlier possible time using the exception times.
 *  Imperfect Solution: Don't use timeperiod definitions that exclude
 *  other timeperods for your host/service check periods. A fix is
 *  being worked on, and will hopefully make it into a 3.4.x release.
