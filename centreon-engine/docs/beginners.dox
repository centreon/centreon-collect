 *  Congratulations on choosing Centreon Engine! Centreon Engine is
 *  quite powerful and flexible, but it can take a lot of work to get
 *  it configured just the way you'd like. Once you become familiar
 *  with how it works and what it can do for you, you'll never want to
 *  be without it. :-) Here are some important things to keep in mind
 *  for first-time Centreon Engine users:
 *
 *  1. Relax - it's going to take some time. Don't expect to be able to
 *  get things working exactly the way you want them right off the bat.
 *  it's not that easy. Setting up Centreon Engine can involve a bit
 *  of work - partly because of the options that Centreon Engine
 *  offers, partly because you need to know what to monitor on your
 *  network (and how best to do it).
 *
 *  2. Use the quickstart instructions. The @link
 *  quickstartinstallationguides quickstart installation guide @endlink
 *  is designed to get most new users up and running with a basic
 *  Centreon Engine setup fairly quickly. Within 20 minutes you can
 *  have Centreon Engine installed and monitoring your local system.
 *  Once that's complete, you can move on to learning how to configure
 *  Centreon Engine to do more.
 *
 *  3. Read the documentation. Centreon Engine can be tricky to
 *  configure when you've got a good grasp of what's going on, and
 *  nearly impossible if you don't. Make sure you read the
 *  documentation (particularly the sections on "Configuring Centreon
 *  Engine" and "The Basics"). Save the advanced topics for when
 *  you've got a good understanding of the basics.
 *
 *  4. Seek the help of others. If you've read the documentation,
 *  reviewed the sample config files, and are still having problems,
 *  send an email message describing your problems to the
 *  centengine-users mailing list. Due to the amount of work that I
 *  have to do for this project, I am unable to answer most of the
 *  questions that get sent directly to me, so your best source of help
 *  is going to be the mailing list. If you've done some background
 *  reading and you provide a good problem description, odds are that
 *  someone will give you some pointers on getting things working
 *  properly. More information on subscribing to the mailing lists or
 *  searching the list archives can be found at
 *  http://XXX/support/.
