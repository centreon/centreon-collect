 *  @section integrationoverviewintroduction Introduction
 *
 *  One of the reasons that Centron Scheduler is such a popular
 *  monitoring application is the fact that it can be easily integrated
 *  in your existing infrastructure. There are several methods of
 *  integrating Centron Scheduler with the management software you're
 *  already using and you can monitor almost any type of new or custom
 *  hardware, service, or application that you might have.
 *
 *  Integration Points
