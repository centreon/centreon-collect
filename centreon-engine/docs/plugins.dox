 *  @section pluginsintroduction Introduction
 *
 *  Unlike many other monitoring tools, Centreon Engine does not
 *  include any internal mechanisms for checking the status of hosts
 *  and services on your network. Instead, Centreon Engine relies on
 *  external programs (called plugins) to do all the dirty work.
 *
 *  @section pluginswhatareplugins What Are Plugins?
 *
 *  Plugins are compiled executables or scripts (Perl scripts, shell
 *  scripts, etc.) that can be run from a command line to check the
 *  status or a host or service. Centreon Engine uses the results
 *  from plugins to determine the current status of hosts and services
 *  on your network.
 *
 *  Centreon Engine will execute a plugin whenever there is a need to
 *  check the status of a service or host. The plugin does something
 *  (notice the very general term) to perform the check and then simply
 *  returns the results to Centreon Engine. Centreon Engine will
 *  process the results that it receives from the plugin and take any
 *  necessary actions (running @link eventhandlers event handlers
 *  @endlink, sending out @link notifications notifications @endlink,
 *  etc).
 *
 *  @section pluginspluginsasanabstractionlayer Plugins As An Abstraction Layer
 *

 *
 *  Plugins act as an abstraction layer between the monitoring logic
 *  present in the Centreon Engine daemon and the actual services and
 *  hosts that are being monitored.
 *
 *  The upside of this type of plugin architecture is that you can
 *  monitor just about anything you can think of. If you can automate
 *  the process of checking something, you can monitor it with Centreon
 *  Engine. There are already a lot of plugins that have been
 *  created in order to monitor basic resources such as processor load,
 *  disk usage, ping rates, etc. If you want to monitor something else,
 *  take a look at the documentation on @link centenginepluginapi
 *  writing plugins @endlink and roll your own. Its simple!
 *
 *  The downside to this type of plugin architecture is the fact that
 *  Centreon Engine has absolutely no idea what it is that you're
 *  monitoring. You could be monitoring network traffic statistics,
 *  data error rates, room temperate, CPU voltage, fan speed, processor
 *  load, disk space, or the ability of your super-fantastic toaster to
 *  properly brown your bread in the morning... Centreon Engine
 *  doesn't understand the specifics of what's being monitored - it
 *  just tracks changes in the state of those resources. Only the
 *  plugins themselves know exactly what they're monitoring and how to
 *  perform the actual checks.
 *
 *  @section pluginswhatpluginsareavailable What Plugins Are Available?
 *
 *  There are plugins currently available to monitor many different
 *  kinds of devices and services, including:
 *
 *  - HTTP, POP3, IMAP, FTP, SSH, DHCP
 *  - CPU Load, Disk Usage, Memory Usage, Current Users
 *  - Unix/Linux, Windows, and Netware Servers
 *  - Routers and Switches
 *  - etc.
 *
 *  @section pluginsobtainingplugins Obtaining Plugins
 *
 *  Plugins are not distributed with Centreon Engine, but you can
 *  download the official Centreon Engine plugins and many additional
 *  plugins created and maintained by Centreon Engine users from the
 *  following locations:
 *
 *  - Centreon Engine Plugins Project: http://XXX/
 *  - Centreon Engine Downloads Page: http://XXX/download/
 *  - Centreon EngineExchange.org: http://XXX/
 *
 *  @section pluginshowdoiusepluginx How Do I Use Plugin X?
 *
 *  Most all plugins will display basic usage information when you
 *  execute them using '-h' or '--help' on the command line. For
 *  example, if you want to know how the check_http plugin works or
 *  what options it accepts, you should try executing the following
 *  command:
 *
 *  @code
 *  ./check_http --help
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  @section pluginspluginapi Plugin API
 *
 *  You can find information on the technical aspects of plugins, as
 *  well as how to go about creating your own custom plugins @link
 *  centenginepluginapi here @endlink.
