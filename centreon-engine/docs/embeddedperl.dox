 *  @page usingtheembeddedperlinterpreter Using The Embedded Perl Interpreter
 *  @section usingtheembeddedperlinterpreterintroduction Introduction
 *
 *  Centreon Scheduler can be compiled with support for an embedded Perl
 *  interpreter. This allows Centreon Scheduler to execute Perl plugins
 *  much more efficiently that it otherwise would, so it may be of
 *  interest to you if you rely heavily on plugins written in Perl.
 *
 *  Without the embedded Perl interpreter, Centreon Scheduler executes
 *  Perl (and non-Perl) plugins by forking and executing the plugins as
 *  an external command. When the embedded Perl interpreter is used,
 *  Centreon Scheduler can execute Perl plugins by simply making a
 *  library call.
 *
 *  @note Tip: The embedded Perl interpreter works with all Perl scripts
 *  that Centreon Scheduler executes - not just plugins. This
 *  documentation discusses the embedded Perl interpreter in relation to
 *  plugins used for host and service checks, but it applies just the
 *  same to other types of Perl scripts you may be using for other types
 *  of commands (e.g. notification scripts, event handler scripts, etc.).
 *
 *  Stephen Davies contributed the original embedded Perl interpreter
 *  code several years back. Stanley Hopcroft has been the primary
 *  person helping to improve the embedded Perl interpreter code quite
 *  a bit and has commented on the advantages/disadvanges of using it.
 *  He has also given several helpful hints on creating Perl plugins
 *  that work properly with the embedded interpreter.
 *
 *  It should be noted that "ePN", as used in this documentation,
 *  refers to embedded Perl Centreon Scheduler, or if you prefer,
 *  Centreon Scheduler compiled with an embedded Perl interpreter.
 *
 *  @section usingtheembeddedperlinterpreteradvantages Advantages
 *
 *  Some advantages of ePN (embedded Perl Centreon Scheduler) include:
 *  - Centreon Scheduler will spend much less time running your Perl
 *  plugins because it no longer forks to execute the plugin (each
 *  time loading the Perl interpreter). Instead, it executes your
 *  plugin by making a library call.
 *  - It greatly reduces the system impact of Perl plugins and/or
 *  allows you to run more checks with Perl plugin than you otherwise
 *  would be able to. In other words, you have less incentive to write
 *  plugins in other languages such as C/C++, or Expect/TCL, that are
 *  generally recognised to have development times at least an order
 *  of magnitude slower than Perl (although they do run about ten
 *  times faster also - TCL being an exception).
 *  - If you are not a C programmer, then you can still get a huge
 *  amount of mileage out of Centreon Scheduler by letting Perl do all
 *  the heavy lifting without having Centreon Scheduler slow right
 *  down. Note however, that the ePN will not speed up your plugin
 *  (apart from eliminating the interpreter load time). If you want
 *  fast plugins then consider Perl XSUBs (XS), or C after you are
 *  sure that your Perl is tuned and that you have a suitable
 *  algorithm (Benchmark.pm is invaluable for comparing the
 *  performance of Perl language elements).
 *  - Using the ePN is an excellent opportunity to learn more about
 *  Perl.
 *
 *  @section usingtheembeddedperlinterpreterdisadvantages Disadvantages
 *
 *  The disadvantages of ePN (embedded Perl Centreon Scheduler) are much
 *  the same as Apache mod_perl (i.e. Apache with an embedded
 *  interpreter) compared to a plain Apache:
 *  - A Perl program that works fine with plain Centreon Scheduler may
 *  not work with the ePN. You may have to modify your plugins to get
 *  them to work.
 *  - Perl plugins are harder to debug under an ePN than under a plain
 *  Centreon Scheduler.
 *  - Your ePN will have a larger SIZE (memory footprint) than a plain
 *  Centreon Scheduler.
 *  - Some Perl constructs cannot be used or may behave differently
 *  than what you would expect.
 *  - You may have to be aware of 'more than one way to do it' and
 *  choose a way that seems less attractive or obvious.
 *  - You will need greater Perl knowledge (but nothing very esoteric
 *  or stuff about Perl internals - unless your plugin uses XSUBS).
 *
 *  @section usingtheembeddedperlinterpreterusingtheembeddedperlinterpreter Using The Embedded Perl Interpreter
 *
 *  If you want to use the embedded Perl interpreter to run your Perl
 *  plugins and scripts, here's what you'll need to do:
 *  - Compile Centreon Scheduler with support for the embedded Perl
 *  interpreter (see instructions below).
 *  - Enable the @ref mainconfigurationfileoptionsconfigurationfilevariablesembeddedperlinterpreteroption
 *  "enable_embedded_perl" option in the main configuration file.
 *  - Set the @ref mainconfigurationfileoptionsconfigurationfilevariablesembeddedperlimplicituseoption
 *  "use_embedded_perl_implicitly" option to fit your needs.
 *  This option determines whether or not the Perl interpreter should
 *  be used by default for individual Perl plugins and scripts.
 *  - Optionally enable or disable certain Perl plugins and scripts
 *  from being run using the embedded Perl interpreter. This can be
 *  useful if certain Perl scripts have problems being running under
 *  the Perl interpreter. See instructions below for more information
 *  on doing this.
 *
 *  @section usingtheembeddedperlinterpretercompilingcentschedulerwithembeddedperl Compiling Centreon Scheduler With Embedded Perl
 *
 *  If you want to use the embedded Perl interpreter, you'll first need
 *  to compile Centreon Scheduler with support for it.
 *
 *  To do this, simply run the configure script with the addition of
 *  the --enable-embedded-perl option. If you want the embedded
 *  interpreter to cache internally compiled scripts, add the
 *  --with-perlcache option as well. Example:
 *
 *  @code
 *  ./configure --enable-embedded-perl --with-perlcache otheroptions...
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  Once you've rerun the configure script with the new options, make
 *  sure to recompile Centreon Scheduler.
 *
 *  @section usingtheembeddedperlinterpreterpluginspecificuseoftheperlinterpreter Plugin-Specific Use of the Perl Interpreter
 *
 *  Beginning with Centreon Scheduler 3, you can specify which Perl
 *  plugins or scripts should or should not be run under the embedded
 *  Perl interpreter. This is particularly useful if you have
 *  troublesome Perl scripts which do not work well with the Perl
 *  interpreter.
 *
 *  To explicitly tell Centreon Scheduler whether or not to use the
 *  embedded Perl interpreter for a particular perl script, add one of
 *  the following entries to your Perl script/plugin...
 *
 *  To tell Centreon Scheduler to use the Perl interpreter for a
 *  particular script, add this line to the Perl script:
 *
 *  @code
 *  # centscheduler: +epn
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  To tell Centreon Scheduler to NOT use the embedded Perl interpreter
 *  for a particular script, add this line to the Perl script:
 *
 *  @code
 *  # centscheduler: -epn
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  Either line must be located within the first 10 lines of a script
 *  for Centreon Scheduler to detect it.
 *
 *  @note Tip: If you do not explicitly use the method above to tell
 *  Centreon Scheduler whether an individual plugin can be run under the
 *  Perl interpreter, Centreon Scheduler will make will a decision for
 *  you. This decision process is controlled by the
 *  @ref mainconfigurationfileoptionsconfigurationfilevariablesembeddedperlimplicituseoption
 *  "use_embedded_perl_implicitly" variable. If the value is set
 *  to 1, all Perl plugins/scripts (that do not explicitly
 *  enable/disable the ePN) will be run under the Perl interpreter. If
 *  the value is 0, they will NOT be run under the Perl interpreter.
