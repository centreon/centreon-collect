 *  @section objectconfigurationoverviewwhatareobjects What Are Objects?
 *
 *  Objects are all the elements that are involved in the monitoring
 *  and notification logic. Types of objects include:
 *  - Services
 *  - Service Groups
 *  - Hosts
 *  - Host Groups
 *  - Contacts
 *  - Contact Groups
 *  - Commands
 *  - Time Periods
 *  - Notification Escalations
 *  - Notification and Execution Dependencies
 *
 *  More information on what objects are and how they relate to each
 *  other can be found below.
 *
 *  @section objectconfigurationoverviewwhereareobjectsdefined Where Are Objects Defined?
 *
 *  Objects can be defined in one or more configuration files and/or
 *  directories that you specify using the
 *  @ref mainconfigurationfileoptionsconfigurationfilevariablesobjectconfigurationfile
 *  "cfg_file" and/or
 *  @ref mainconfigurationfileoptionsconfigurationfilevariablesobjectconfigurationdirectory
 *  "cfg_dir" directives in the main configuration file.
 *
 *  @note Tip: When you follow
 *  @ref quickstartinstallationguide "quickstart installation guide",
 *  several sample object configuration files are placed in
 *  @em /usr/local/centengine/etc/objects/. You can use these sample
 *  files to see how object inheritance works and learn how to define
 *  your own object definitions.
 *
 *  @section objectconfigurationoverviewhowareobjectsdefined How Are Objects Defined?
 *
 *  Objects are defined in a flexible template format, which can make
 *  it much easier to manage your Centreon Engine configuration in
 *  the long term. Basic information on how to define objects in your
 *  configuration files can be found @link objectdefinitions here
 *  @endlink.
 *
 *  Once you get familiar with the basics of how to define objects, you
 *  should read up on @link objectinheritance.html object inheritance
 *  @endlink, as it will make your configuration more robust for the
 *  future. Seasoned users can exploit some advanced features of object
 *  definitions as described in the documentation on @link
 *  timesavingtricksforobjectdefinitions object tricks @endlink.
 *
 *  @section objectconfigurationoverviewobjectsexplained Objects Explained
 *
 *  Some of the main object types are explained in greater detail
 *  below...
 *
 *  @ref objectdefinitionsobjecttypeshostdefinition "Host" are one of the
 *  central objects in the monitoring logic. Important attributes of
 *  hosts are as follows:
 *  - Hosts are usually physical devices on your network (servers,
 *  workstations, routers, switches, printers, etc).
 *  - Hosts have an address of some kind (e.g. an IP or MAC address).
 *  - Hosts have one or more more services associated with them.
 *  - Hosts can have parent/child relationships with other hosts, often
 *  representing real-world network connections, which is used in the
 *  @link determiningstatusandreachabilityofnetworkhosts network reachability @endlink
 *  logic.
 *
 *  @ref objectdefinitionsobjecttypeshostgroupdefinition "Host Groups" are
 *  groups of one or more hosts. Host groups can make it easier to
 *  (1) view the status of related hosts in the Centreon Engine web
 *  interface and (2) simplify your configuration through the use of
 *  @link timesavingtricksforobjectdefinitions object tricks @endlink.

 *
 *  @ref objectdefinitionsobjecttypesservicedefinitionservice "Services" are one of
 *  the central objects in the monitoring logic. Services are associated
 *  with hosts and can be:
 *  - Attributes of a host (CPU load, disk usage, uptime, etc.)
 *  - Services provided by the host (HTTP, POP3, FTP, SSH, etc.)
 *  - Other things associated with the host (DNS records, etc.)
 *
 *  @ref objectdefinitionsobjecttypesservicegroupdefinition "Services Groups"
 *  are groups of one or more services. Service groups can make it
 *  easier to (1) view the status of related services in the Centreon
 *  Engine web interface and (2) simplify your configuration through
 *  the use of @link timesavingtricksforobjectdefinitions object tricks @endlink.

 *
 *  @ref objectdefinitionsobjecttypescontactdefinition "Contacts" are people
 *  involved in the notification process:
 *  - Contacts have one or more notification methods (cellphone, pager,
 *  email, instant messaging, etc.)
 *  - Contacts receive notifications for hosts and service they are
 *  responsible for
 *
 *  @ref objectdefinitionsobjecttypescontactgroupdefinition "Contacts Groups"
 *  are groups of one or more contacts. Contact groups can make it
 *  easier to define all the people who get notified when certain host
 *  or service problems occur.
 *

 *
 *  @ref objectdefinitionsobjecttypestimeperioddefinition "Timeperiods" are are
 *  used to control:
 *  - When hosts and services can be monitored
 *  - When contacts can receive notifications
 *
 *  Information on how timeperiods work can be found @link
 *  timeperiods.html here @endlink.

 *
 *  @ref objectdefinitionsobjecttypescommanddefinition "Commands" are used to
 *  tell Centreon Engine what programs, scripts, etc. it should
 *  execute to perform:
 *  - Host and service checks
 *  - Notifications
 *  - Event handlers
 *  - and more...
