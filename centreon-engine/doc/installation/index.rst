Installation
############

Centreon recommends using its official packages from the Centreon Open Sources
version available free of charge on our repository (ex CES). Most of Centreon endorsed
software are available as RPM packages.

Alternatively, you can build and install your own version of this
software by following the :ref:`user_installation_using_sources`.

**************
Using packages
**************

Centreon provides RPM for its products through Centreon Open Sources (COS) version
available free of charge on our repository.
Open source products are freely available from our repository.
These packages are available for CentOS 6 or 7 architecture x86_64, which is
the sole platform officially supported by Centreon

.. _user_installation_packages_prerequisites:

Prerequisites
=============

In order to use RPM from the COS repository, you have to install the
appropriate repository.

CentOS 6
--------

Run the following commands as privileged user ::

  $ wget http://yum.centreon.com/standard/3.4/el6/stable/noarch/RPMS/centreon-release-3.4-4.el6.noarch.rpm
  $ yum install --nogpgcheck -y centreon-release-3.4-4.el6.noarch.rpm
  $ rm -f centreon-release-3.4-4.el6.noarch.rpm
  $ yum clean all


CentOS 7
--------

Run the following commands as privileged user ::

  $ wget http://yum.centreon.com/standard/3.4/el7/stable/noarch/RPMS/centreon-release-3.4-4.el7.centos.noarch.rpm
  $ yum install --nogpgcheck -y centreon-release-3.4-4.el7.centos.noarch.rpm
  $ rm -f centreon-release-3.4-4.el7.centos.noarch.rpm
  $ yum clean all


Install
=======

Run the following commands as privileged user ::

  $ yum install centreon-engine

All dependencies are automatically installed from Centreon repositories.

.. _user_installation_using_sources:

*************
Using sources
*************

To build Centreon Engine, you will need the following external
dependencies:

  * a C++ compilation environment.
  * CMake **(>= 2.8)**, a cross-platform build system.
  * Centreon Clib **(>= 1.4)**, The centreon core library.

This program is compatible only with Unix-like platforms (Linux,
FreeBSD, Solaris, ...).

Prerequisites
=============

If you decide to build Centreon Engine from sources, we heavily
recommand that you create dedicated system user and group for
security purposes.

On all systems the commands to create a user and a group both named
**centreon-engine** are as follow (need to run these as root) ::

  $ groupadd centreon-engine
  $ useradd -g centreon-engine -m -r -d /var/lib/centreon-engine centreon-engine

Please note that these user and group will be used in the next steps. If
you decide to change user and/or group name here, please do so in
further steps too.

Build
=====

Get sources
-----------

Centreon Engine can be checked out from GitHub at
https://github.com/centreon/centreon-engine. On a Linux box with git
installed this is just a matter of ::

  $ git clone https://github.com/centreon/centreon-engine

Or You can get the latest Centreon Engine's sources from its
`download website <https://download.centreon.com/>`_
Once downloaded, extract it ::

  $ tar xzf centreon-engine.tar.gz

Configuration
-------------

At the root of the project directory you'll find a build directory
which holds build scripts. Generate the Makefile by running the
following command ::

  $ cd /path_to_centreon_engine/build

Your Centreon Engine can be tweaked to your particular needs
using CMake's variable system. Variables can be set like this ::

  $ cmake -D<variable1>=<value1> [-D<variable2>=<value2>] .

     -DWITH_PREFIX_BIN=/usr/sbin \
     -DWITH_PREFIX_CONF=/etc/centreon-engine \
     -DWITH_PREFIX_LIB=/usr/lib/centreon-engine \
     -DWITH_USER=centreon-engine \
     -DWITH_GROUP=centreon-engine \
     -DWITH_LOGROTATE_SCRIPT=1 \

     -DWITH_PKGCONFIG_SCRIPT=1 \
     -DWITH_PKGCONFIG_DIR=/usr/lib/pkgconfig \
     -DWITH_TESTING=0

At this step, the software will check for existence and usability of the
rerequisites. If one cannot be found, an appropriate error message will
be printed. Otherwise an installation summary will be printed.

.. note::
  If you need to change the options you used to compile your software,
  you might want to remove the *CMakeCache.txt* file that is in the
  *build* directory. This will remove cache entries that might have been
  computed during the last configuration step.

Compilation
-----------

Once properly configured, the compilation process is really simple ::

  $ make

And wait until compilation completes.

Install
=======

Once compiled, the following command must be run as privileged user to
finish installation ::

  $ make install

And wait for its completion.

Check-Up
========

After a successful installation, you should check for the existence of
some of the following files.

================================================ =========================================
File                                             Description
================================================ =========================================
