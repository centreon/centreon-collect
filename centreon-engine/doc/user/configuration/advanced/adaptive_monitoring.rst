Adaptive Monitoring
*******************

Introduction
============

Centreon Engine allows you to change certain commands and host and
service check attributes during runtime. I'll refer to this feature as
"adaptive monitoring". Please note that the adaptive monitoring features
found in Centreon Engine will probably not be of much use to 99% of
users, but they do allow you to do some neat things.

What Can Be Changed?
====================

The following service check attributes can be changed during runtime:

  * Check command (and command arguments)
  * Check interval
  * Max check attempts
  * Check timeperiod
  * Event handler command (and command arguments)

The following host check attributes can be changed during runtime:

  * Check command (and command arguments)
  * Check interval
  * Max check attempts
  * Check timeperiod
  * Event handler command (and command arguments)

The following global attributes can be changed during runtime:

  * Global host event handler command (and command arguments)
  * Global service event handler command (and command arguments)

External Commands For Adaptive Monitoring
=========================================

In order to change global or host- or service-specific attributes during
runtime, you must submit the appropriate
:ref:`external command <external_commands>` to Centreon Engine via the
:ref:`external command file <basics_main_configuration_file_options#main_configuration_file_optionsconfigurationfilevariablesexternalcommandfile>`.
The table below lists the different attributes that may be changed
during runtime, along with the external command to accomplish the job.

A full listing of external commands that can be used for adaptive
monitoring (along with examples of how to use them) can be found online
at the following URL: http://XXX/developerinfo/external_commands/

.. note::

   When changing check commands, check timeperiods, or event handler
   commands, it is important to note that the new values for these
   options must have been defined before Centreon Engine was
   started. Any request to change a command or timeperiod to one which
   had not been defined when Centreon Engine was started is ignored. You
   can specify command arguments along with the actual command name -
   just seperate individual arguments from the command name (and from
   each other) using bang (!) characters. More information on how
   arguments in command definitions are processed during runtime can be
   found in the documentation on
   :ref:`macros <basics_understanding_macros_and_how_they_work>`.
