Host Checks
***********

Introduction
============

The basic workings of host checks are described here...

When Are Host Checks Performed?
===============================

Hosts are checked by the Centreon Engine daemon:

  * At regular intervals, as defined by the check_interval and
    retry_interval options in your
    :ref:`host definitions <basics_object_definitions#object_definitionsobjecttypeshostdefinition>`.
  * On-demand when a service associated with the host changes state.
  * On-demand as needed as part of the
    :ref:`host reachability <advanced_determining_status_and_reachability_of_network_hosts>`
    logic.
  * On-demand as needed for
    :ref:`predictive <advanced_host_and_service_dependencies>`
    host dependency checks".

Regularly scheduled host checks are optional. If you set the
check_interval option in your host definition to zero (0), Centreon
Engine will not perform checks of the hosts on a regular basis. It will,
however, still perform on-demand checks of the host as needed for other
parts of the monitoring logic.

On-demand checks are made when a service associated with the host
changes state because Centreon Engine needs to know whether the host has
also changed state. Services that change state are often an indicator
that the host may have also changed state. For example, if Centreon
Engine detects that the HTTP service associated with a host just changed
from a CRITICAL to an OK state, it may indicate that the host just
recovered from a reboot and is now back up and running.

On-demand checks of hosts are also made as part of the
:ref:`host reachability <advanced_determining_status_and_reachability_of_network_hosts>`
logic. Centreon Engine is designed to detect network outages as quickly
as possible, and distinguish between DOWN and UNREACHABLE host
states. These are very different states and can help an admin quickly
locate the cause of a network outage.

On-demand checks are also performed as part of the
:ref:`predictive host dependency check <advanced_host_and_service_dependencies>`
logic. These checks help ensure that the dependency logic is as accurate
as possible.

Cached Host Checks
==================

The performance of on-demand host checks can be significantly improved
by implementing the use of cached checks, which allow Centreon Engine to
forgo executing a host check if it determines a relatively recent check
result will do instead. More information on cached checks can be found
:ref:`here <advanced_cached_checks>`.

Dependencies and Checks
=======================

You can define
:ref:`host <basics_object_definitions#object_definitionsobjecttypeshostdependencydefinition>`
execution dependencies" that prevent Centreon Engine from checking the
status of a host depending on the state of one or more other hosts. More
information on dependencies can be found
:ref:`here <[advanced_host_and_service_dependencies>`.

Parallelization of
==================

Host Checks

Scheduled host checks are run in parallel. When Centreon Engine needs to
run a scheduled host check, it will initiate the host check and then
return to doing other work (running service checks, etc). The host check
runs in a child process that was fork()ed from the main Centreon Engine
daemon. When the host check has completed, the child process will inform
the main Centreon Engine process (its parent) of the check results. The
main Centreon Engine process then handles the check results and takes
appropriate action (running event handlers, sending notifications,
etc.).

On-demand host checks are also run in parallel if needed. As mentioned
earlier, Centreon Engine can forgo the actual execution of an on-demand
host check if it can use the cached results from a relatively recent
host check.

When Centreon Engine processes the results of scheduled and on-demand
host checks, it may initiate (secondary) checks of other hosts. These
checks can be initated for two reasons: :ref:`predictive dependency
checks <[advanced_host_and_service_dependencies>` and to determining the
status of the host using the
:ref:`network reachability <advanced_determining_status_and_reachability_of_network_hosts>`
logic. The secondary checks that are initiated are usually run in
parallel. However, there is one big exception that you should be aware
of, as it can have negative effect on performance...

.. note::

   Hosts which have their max_check_attempts value set to 1 can cause
   serious performance problems. The reason? If Centreon Engine needs to
   determine their true state using the
   :ref:`network reachability <advanced_determining_status_and_reachability_of_network_hosts>`
   logic (to see if they're DOWN or UNREACHABLE), it will have to launch
   serial checks of all of the host's immediate parents. Just to
   reiterate, those checks are run serially, rather than in parallel, so
   it can cause a big performance hit. For this reason, I would
   recommend that you always use a value greater than 1 for the
   max_check_attempts directives in your host definitions.

Host States
===========

Hosts that are checked can be in one of three different states:

  * UP
  * DOWN
  * UNREACHABLE

Host State Determination
========================

Host checks are performed by :ref:`plugins <get_started/plugins>`, which
can return a state of OK, WARNING, UNKNOWN, or CRITICAL. How does
Centreon Engine translate these plugin return codes into host states of
UP, DOWN, or UNREACHABLE? Lets see...

The table below shows how plugin return codes correspond with
preliminary host states. Some post-processing (which is described later)
is done which may then alter the final host state.

============= ======================
Plugin Result Preliminary Host State
============= ======================
OK            UP
WARNING       UP or DOWN
UNKNOWN       DOWN
CRITICAL      DOWN
============= ======================

.. note::

   WARNING results usually means the host is UP. However, WARNING
   results are interpreted to mean the host is DOWN if the
   :ref:`use_aggressive_host_checking <basics_main_configuration_file_options#main_configuration_file_optionsconfigurationfilevariablesaggressivehostcheckingoption>`
   option is enabled.

If the preliminary host state is DOWN, Centreon Engine will attempt to
see if the host is really DOWN or if it is UNREACHABLE. The distinction
between DOWN and UNREACHABLE host states is important, as it allows
admins to determine root cause of network outages faster. The following
table shows how Centreon Engine makes a final state determination based
on the state of the hosts parent(s). A host's parents are defined in the
parents directive in host definition.

====================== ========================================== ================
Preliminary Host State Parent Host State                          Final Host State
====================== ========================================== ================
DOWN                   At least one parent is UP                  DOWN
DOWN                   All parents are either DOWN or UNREACHABLE UNREACHABLE
====================== ========================================== ================

More information on how Centreon Engine distinguishes between DOWN and
UNREACHABLE states can be found
:ref:`here <advanced_determining_status_and_reachability_of_network_hosts>`.

Host State Changes
==================

As you are probably well aware, hosts don't always stay in one
state. Things break, patches get applied, and servers need to be
rebooted. When Centreon Engine checks the status of hosts, it will be
able to detect when a host changes between UP, DOWN, and UNREACHABLE
states and take appropriate action. These state changes result in
different :ref:`state types <state_types>` (HARD or SOFT), which can
trigger :ref:`event handlers <advanced_event_handlers>` to be run and
:ref:`notifications <notifications>` to be sent out. Detecting and
dealing with state changes is what Centreon Engine is all about.

When hosts change state too frequently they are considered to be
"flapping". A good example of a flapping host would be server that keeps
spontaneously rebooting as soon as the operating system loads. That's
always a fun scenario to have to deal with. Centreon Engine can detect
when hosts start flapping, and can suppress notifications until flapping
stops and the host's state stabilizes. More information on the flap
detection logic can be found
:ref:`here <advanced_detection_and_handling_of_state_flapping>`.
