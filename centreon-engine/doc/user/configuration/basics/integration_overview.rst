Integration Overview
********************

Introduction
============

One of the reasons that Centreon Engine is such a popular monitoring
application is the fact that it can be easily integrated in your
existing infrastructure. There are several methods of integrating
Centreon Engine with the management software you're already using and
you can monitor almost any type of new or custom hardware, service, or
application that you might have.
