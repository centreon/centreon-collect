 *  @page configurationoverview Configuration Overview
 *  @section configurationoverviewintroduction Introduction
 *
 *  There are several different configuration files that you're going
 *  to need to create or edit before you start monitoring anything. Be
 *  patient! Configuring Centreon Engine can take quite a while,
 *  especially if you're first-time user. Once you figure out how
 *  things work, it'll all be well worth your time. :-)
 *
 *  @note Sample configuration files are installed in the
 *  /usr/local/centengine/etc/ directory when you follow the
 *  @ref quickstartinstallationguide "quickstart installation guide".

 *  @section configurationoverviewmainconfigurationfile Main
 *  Configuration File
 *
 *  The main configuration file contains a number of directives that
 *  affect how the Centreon Engine daemon operates. This is where
 *  you're going to want to get started in your configuration
 *  adventures.
 *
 *  Documentation for the main configuration file can be found @link
 *  mainconfigurationfileoptions here @endlink.
 *
 *  @section configurationoverviewresourcefiles Resource File(s)
 *
 *  Resource files can be used to store user-defined macros. The main
 *  point of having resource files is to use them to store sensitive
 *  configuration information (like passwords).
 *
 *  You can specify one or more optional resource files by using the
 *  @ref mainconfigurationfileoptionsconfigurationfilevariablesresourcefile
 *  "resource_file" directive in your main configuration file.
 *
 *  @section configurationoverviewobjectdefinitionfiles Object
 *  Definition Files
 *
 *  Object definition files are used to define hosts, services,
 *  hostgroups, contacts, contactgroups, commands, etc. This is where
 *  you define all the things you want monitor and how you want to
 *  monitor them.
 *
 *  You can specify one or more object definition files by using the
 *  @ref mainconfigurationfileoptionsconfigurationfilevariablesobjectconfigurationfile
 *  "cfg_file" and/or
 *  @ref mainconfigurationfileoptionsconfigurationfilevariablesobjectconfigurationdirectory
 *  "cfg_dir" directives in your main configuration file.
 *
 *  An introduction to object definitions, and how they relate to each
 *  other, can be found @link objectconfigurationoverview here @endlink.
