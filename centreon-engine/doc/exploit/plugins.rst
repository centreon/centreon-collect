Introduction
============

Unlike many other monitoring tools, Centreon Engine does not include any
internal mechanisms for checking the status of hosts and services on
your network. Instead, Centreon Engine relies on external programs
(called plugins) to do all the dirty work.

What Are Plugins?
=================

Plugins are compiled executables or scripts (Perl scripts, shell
scripts, etc.) that can be run from a command line to check the status
or a host or service. Centreon Engine uses the results from plugins to
determine the current status of hosts and services on your network.

Centreon Engine will execute a plugin whenever there is a need to check
the status of a service or host. The plugin does something (notice the
very general term) to perform the check and then simply returns the
results to Centreon Engine. Centreon Engine will process the results
that it receives from the plugin and take any necessary actions (running
:ref:`event handlers <event_handlers>`,
sending out :ref:`notifications <notifications>`,
etc).

Plugins As An Abstraction Layer
===============================

.. image:: /_static/images/plugins.png

Plugins act as an abstraction layer between the monitoring logic present
in the Centreon Engine daemon and the actual services and hosts that are
being monitored.

The upside of this type of plugin architecture is that you can monitor
just about anything you can think of. If you can automate the process of
checking something, you can monitor it with Centreon Engine. There are
already a lot of plugins that have been created in order to monitor
basic resources such as processor load, disk usage, ping rates, etc. If
you want to monitor something else, take a look at the documentation on
:ref:`writing plugins <centengine_plugin_api>`
and roll your own. Its simple!

The downside to this type of plugin architecture is the fact that
Centreon Engine has absolutely no idea what it is that you're
monitoring. You could be monitoring network traffic statistics, data
error rates, room temperate, CPU voltage, fan speed, processor load,
disk space, or the ability of your super-fantastic toaster to properly
brown your bread in the morning... Centreon Engine doesn't understand
the specifics of what's being monitored - it just tracks changes in the
state of those resources. Only the plugins themselves know exactly what
they're monitoring and how to perform the actual checks.

What Plugins Are Available?
===========================

There are plugins currently available to monitor many different kinds of
devices and services, including:

  * HTTP, POP3, IMAP, FTP, SSH, DHCP
  * CPU Load, Disk Usage, Memory Usage, Current Users
  * Unix/Linux, Windows, and Netware Servers
  * Routers and Switches
  * etc ...

Obtaining Plugins
=================

Plugins are not distributed with Centreon Engine, but you can download
the official Centreon Engine plugins and many additional plugins created
and maintained by Centreon Engine users from the following locations:

  * `Centreon Engine Plugins Project <http://www.centreon.com/>`_
  * `Centreon Engine Downloads Page <http://www.centreon.com/Content-Download/donwload-centreon-monitoring-tools>`_
  * `nagiosexchange.org <http://exchange.nagios.org/>`_

How Do I Use Plugin X?
======================

Most all plugins will display basic usage information when you execute
them using '-h' or '--help' on the command line. For example, if you
want to know how the check_http plugin works or what options it accepts,
you should try executing the following command::

    $ ./check_http --help

Plugin API

You can find information on the technical aspects of plugins, as well as
how to go about creating your own custom plugins
