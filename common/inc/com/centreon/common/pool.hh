/**
 * @brief The Broker's thread pool.
 *
 * At the origin, this thread pool is configured to be used by ASIO. Each thread
 * in this pool runs an io_context that allows any part in Broker to post
 * a work to be done.
 *
 * This pool may look a little complicated. We can see inside it several
 * attributes, let's make a quick tour of them. A thread pool is an array of
 * threads. This array, here, is a std::forward_list named _pool.
 *
 * This pool is instanciated through a unique instance. So its constructor is
 * private and we have a static method named instance() to get it.
 *
 * Initially, the pool is not started. To start it, there is a static method
 * named set_pool_size() that takes one argument: the number of threads.
 * This method can be called several times, if pool_size is greater than
 * previous one, pool_size is increased, otherwise it has no effect
 *
 * So we call first load in main of cbd or engine and then we have to call
 * set_pool_size to start thread(s)
 *
 * In order to avoid link issues, _instance member must be defined in final
 * executables
